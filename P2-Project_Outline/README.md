For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is an app where a user can browse yoga poses and create a custom yoga routine by dragging and dropping chosen poses. 

The user can view information and photos for each pose, as well as determine the length of time desired for each pose. When they press start on their routine, they will hear instructions on how to perform the first pose. After the chosen amount of time for each pose passes, the user will be cued into the next pose.

### Features
* **Pose Directory:** Users will be able to view/choose from a library of yoga poses that they would like to add to their routine.
* **Pose Info/Modal:** A modal will pop up when a pose is clicked on, providing information about the pose. It will also allow a pose to be added to the current yoga routine. 
* **Routine Builder:** This will allow the user to edit (add/delete) & re-arrange yoga poses to assemble a custom routine.
* **Routine Player:** This allows the user to run through a routine. The user will be able to play, pause, stop & exit the playback of the custom routine. They will also be able to view the length of their custom routine, view their progress throughout the routine playback, and view the pose that is coming up next.

### Technologies
* React
* JavaScript & JSX
* CSS
* Material UI
* Possibly: Garage band or Adobe Audition for editing audio

### What I'll Have to Learn
* How to include audio and an audio player for the vocal yoga pose instructions
* How to drag and drop elements in React
* If we create our own data for the yoga poses: how to create our own API and fetch it from the app
* If there are any yoga APIs out there that would be preferrable to use for our app's data
